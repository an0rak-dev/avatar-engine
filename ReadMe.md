A VR first game engine.

## Description

This engine has the only purpose to be a side project, and to keep my mind 
busy while learning new things.

If I can make a game or two from it, it will be a bonus.

I use the Git commit messages as a real diary, so if you want to know how
I came to this or that, or details of my life, you can just read it.

## How to build it

For the moment, it's a big Work In Progress, so you'll need Visual Studio 
(because I use that), and you just have to open the .sln file in it.
